1. Make sure you are up to date with `git pull`
2. Make a new branch using `git checkout -b <your_branch>` for your intented modifications.
3. Add or edit the files you wish.
4. Check your status with `git status` and then use `git add` accordingly.
5. Stage in your modifications, `git commit`, and please write a proper commit message.
