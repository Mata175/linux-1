# Contributing to Linux-1

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo (or pull if you've forked already) and create your branch from master.

   Either `git clone` or `git pull`, and `git checkout -b <your_branch>`

2. Add or edit the files you wish and then commit.

   `git status` and `git add`, and then `git commit` with a good commit message.

3. Push your branch and make a pull request.

   `git push -u origin <your_branch>`

4. Feel happy.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs or typos using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

This is to be defined still. Sorry.
